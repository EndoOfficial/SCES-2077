This is the README for Sci-Fi Weapons - 8 Variations.

-- INSTRUCTIONS --

If you are using Unity and want to get up an running right away you can open the "Sci-Fi Weapons (8 Variations).unitypackage" which also comes with an Example Scene.

If not look under the "Base Pack" folder. Here you will see a folder for each weapon type.

Inside each weapon folder will be:
	- A .fbx model
	- A "Shared" folder containing the textures that all the weapon variations use.
	- A "Variation XX" folder containing the textures used by a particular variation.

Make sure to import both the model file and all the textures for that model.

The folder "8 Variations" then contains 7 extra sets of variation textures for each weapon.
